About this Project: This project is a software application designed for simulating an interactive garden where the user decides what native plants are most supported by the lepadotris through the input of the conditions of the garden the user modifies and how much the user's budget is. 

Design Method: This project uses a java language using eclipse IDE with the javaFX design process to enhance the UI for the user to manipulate.

Screens:
Intro: The first screen the user sees. The user has buttions options to create garden, import preexisting gardern, go to a guide, and go to settings.
Garden Initialization: The user will determine their name, their desired budget amount, and the conditions for the garden (Weather type, Soil Type, and Moisture Type)
Guide: The guide will go through how to manipulate the garden application.
Import: This will import the preexisting files in the folder system to edit.
Modify Plot: The main use of the program. The user will manipulate a garden, with the garden conditions and the desired budget, by dragging the plant options (woody or herbaceous) to the plot. The user will then, after placing the plants, visualize the amount of leps as well as the budget given.
Settings: The user will manipulate the features of their garden application by changing it into dark or light mode.
Summary: The user will see the statistical model of their application by visualizing each of plants and how many leps support it. The user will also see, from the bar, their budget met and check if it is lower than the budget desired. 

How To Use:
1. The user will first be introduced to create garden, go to a guide, import a preexisting garden, and settings.
  a. If the user wants to know how to manipulate the application, the guide will be used.
  b. If the user wants to edit their saved garden, the import garden will be used.
  c. If the user wants to change their garden theme, the settings will be used.
2. The user will start by going to create garden.
3. The user will be inputting their name, amount of budget desired, and the conditions for the garden.
  a. The conditions contain Plot Size, Weather (options: sunny, rainy, cloudy), Soil Type (options: dry, medium, moist), and Moisture Type (options: Decent, Medium, Good)
4. The user will start modifying their garden by going to "Create Garden". Note: The "Create Garden" will not be directed unless you inputted the information.
5. The user will start modifying their garden.
  a. The user will drag the native plants (woody or herbaceous) to the plot.
  b. There are no limits in how many plants in the garden as long as the budget that is met is not over the budget that is desired.
  c. The user will see how many leps are there in the plot.
6. The user have options to go to the settings or the summary of their garden.
7. Once modifying the plot is completed, the user will direct to the summary of the screen to see the statistical input of their garden.
8. The user has the option to save their garden in the settings screen or return to the plot for additional editing.
9. In the settings, the user have the option to change their theme of either dark or light.
